    "Processes often need to interact with one another in order to accomplish tasks. In the previous homework example, we saw one simplest way to communicate among the processes: the `homework` process waits for the completion of all `student` processes. Simulus provides a rich set of mechanisms to support inter-process communication. We start by discussing the two basic primitive methods designed specifically for synchronizing and communicating among the simulation processes: one is called a \"trap\" and the other is called a \"semaphore\"."

It turns to \"sprung\" when the trap has been triggered, after which there will be no more processes waiting for the trap.\n",

    "The life of a trap is as follows. A trap starts with the \"unset\" state when it's created. When a process waits for a trap, the trap goes to \"set\", at which state more processes may come and wait on the same trap, and the trap would remain in the same \"set\" state. When a process triggers the trap and if the trap is in the \"set\" state, *all* processes waiting on the trap will be unblocked and resume execution (it's guaranteed there is at least one waiting process when the trap is in the \"set\" state). The trap will then be transitioned into the \"sprung\" state. When a process triggers the trap which is in the \"unset\" state, the trap will just be transitioned to the \"sprung\" state (since there are no processes currently waiting on the trap). If a trap has \"sprung\", further waiting on the trap will be considered as an no-op; that is, the processes trying to wait on a \"sprung\" trap will have not effect; the process will not be suspended.

Internally, we create a trap for the synchronization and use a counter (called `num`) to keep track of the number of processes having reached the barrier so far. The counter is initialized to zero. Each time a process wants to use the barrier, it calls the `barrier()` method, which increments the counter. If the counter is smaller than the total number of processes, the process will be put on hold (using the trap's `wait()` method). Otherwise, if the counter gets to the total number of processes, the process is the last one among the group of processes to reach the barrier. Therefore, it calls the trap's `trigger()` method to release all the waiting processes that have earlier arrived at the barrier. Remember that traps can only be used once.

    "Both traps and semaphores are called **trappables**. An event (i.e., a scheduled function) is a trappable. A process is also a trappable. Simulus provides a very powerful function called `wait()` to block the calling process until any or all of the given trappables are triggered, or until a pre-specified amount of time has elapsed. When we say a trappable is \"triggered\", we mean that the wait condition on the trappable has been satisfied. If it's a trap, it means the trap has been triggered by another process. If it's a semaphore, it means a wait on the semaphore has returned. If it's an event, it means the event has happened (and the event handler has been invoked). If it's a process, it means the process has terminated. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case of a trap, if we have only one trap, say `t`, calling the wait method of the trap, `t.wait()`, is equivalent to calling the simulator's `wait()` function with the trap passed as the argument: `sim.wait(t)`. Similarly, in case of a semaphore, if we have only one semaphore, say `s`, `s.wait()` is equivalent to `sim.wait(s)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator's `wait()` function expects the argument to be either one trappable or a list of trappables. If it takes more than one trappables in a list or tuple, the calling process will be blocked until either *one* of the trappables, or *all* of the trappables are triggered. The behavior depends on the `method` argument: if it's `any`, the wait condition is satisfied as soon as one of the trappables is triggered; if it's 'all', the process needs to wait until all trappables are triggered. If the method argument is not provided, simulus assumes it's 'all' by default."

    "In this example, we create two traps, t1 and t2, and two semaphores, s1 and s2. We also create two processes. The process p1 triggers a trap or a semaphore at 10 seconds interval. The other process p2 first waits on a trap and a semaphore using the default method ('all'). As expected, the process only resumes execution once both trappables have been triggered. The p2 process then waits on the other trap and semaphore using the `any` method. In this case, when one trappable is triggered, the process will resume execution.

    "In the example, when the `wait()` function is called the first time, it returns a list with True and True for the first element of the returned tuple, since both trappables must be triggered before the process can resume execution (because of the 'all' method). In the second time, the function returns True and False. Only the first trappable (the trap t2) is triggered at the time. Because of the method is 'any', one triggered trappable is good enough to satisfy the wait condition. at the third time, the remaining trappable (semaphore s2) is triggered and the function returns a list consisted of only one True element.\n",

    "We can optionally provide an 'offset' or an 'until' argument to the `wait()` function. The 'offset' is the relative time from now until which the process will be put on hold at the latest; if provided, it must be a non-negative value. The 'until' is the absolute time at which the process is expected to resume execution at the latest; if provided, it must not be earlier than the current time.  Either 'offset' or 'until' can be provided, but not both. If both 'offset' and 'until' are ignored (like what we have previously), there will be no time limit on the conditional wait."

    "To be able to perform conditional wait on multiple trappables certainly allows a process-oriented model to be quite expressive. The following shows a good example. Tom and Jerry decides to enter a race. Tom is modeled by processes. Each time Tom enters the race, we create a process, which calls `sleep()` to represent the time duration for the run. The time duration is a random variable from a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 50 (and a cutoff below zero). Jerry is modeled by events. Each time Jerry enters the race, we schedule an event using `sched()` with a time offset representing the time duration for the run. The time duration is a random variable from a uniform distribution between 50 and 100. Tom and Jerry compete for ten times; the next race would start as soon as the previous one finishes. For each race, whoever runs the fastest wins. But if they run for more than 100, both are disqualified for that race. The simulation finds out who eventually wins more races."

    "Earlier in the previous example, we showed traps and semaphores as trappables on which we can perform conditional wait. In this example, we show that both events and processes are also trappables. An instance of the process is returned from the `process()` function, and an instance of the event is returned from the `sched()` function. Both are considered as opaque objects. That is, the users are not expected to inspect the content of a process or event. Rather, the users should simple use the references. A process is a trappable, which is triggered when the process is terminated. An event is also a trappable, which is triggered upon the activation of the event (i.e., when the event handler is invoked).\n",

    "In this example, we call the simulator's `wait()` function to wait for 'any' of the trappables to be triggered. We also provide a time limit of 100 (we use 'offset' as a positional argument). We look at the return value from the `wait()` function to determine the outcome of the race. If the wait is timed out, we need to kill the process and cancel the event. This is done by calling the simulator's `cancel()` method. If Tom wins (when p is triggered), we just cancel the event; and if Jerry wins (when e is triggered), we instead kill the process.\n"
