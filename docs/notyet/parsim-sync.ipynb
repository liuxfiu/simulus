These simulators can be created and run simultaneously on different processors or cores on the same machine or on different interconnected machines in a cluster.

People have been using \"parallel simulation\" to refer to both cases. \n",

This would happen, however, if the other simulator's clock gets too far ahead into the simulated future. \n",
    "\n",
    "In parallel discrete-event simulation terminology, this is called a causality error. Causality error should never happen in simulation as long as we are modeling a world without time traveling. In parallel simulation, one has to contemplate the possibility of causality errors as simulators may executed on separate processors or cores, or even on separate machines. To solve the problem, one could either constrain the time advancement of the simulators to prevent causality errors from happening, or somehow rollback the simulators to an earlier state to correct the causality errors. \n",

For example, in a simulation of a computer system, we could have one or more simulators to model the CPUs or cores, one to model the memory, one for each I/O devices, and so on. To be part of a large model, the simulators need to communicate by sending timestamped messages to each other.\n",
